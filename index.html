            <h3>The Timeline of the Nigerian statesman Chief Obafemi Oyeniyi Awolowo</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>1909</strong> - Born in ijebu-Remo town of Ikenne, in present-day Ogun State of Nigeria</li>
                <li><strong>1920-26</strong> - He attended various schools, including Baptist Boys' High school Abeokuta; after which he qualified as a shorthand typist.
                Subsequently, he served as a clerk at the Wesley College Ibadan, as well as a corrspondent for the Nigerian Times</li>
                <li><strong>1927</strong> - He enrolled in the University of London as an Exernal Student and graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Commerce(Hons.)</li>
                <li><strong>1944</strong> - He went to the UK to study law at the University of London</li>
                <li><strong>1946</strong> - He was called to the Bar by the Honorable Society of the Inner Temple</li>
                <li><strong>1947</strong> - Awolowo was Nigeria's foremost federalist. In his Path to Nigerian Freedom, he was the first systematic federalist manifesto by a Nigerian politician.
                     he advocated federalism as the only basis for equitable national integration</li>
                <li><strong>1949</strong> - He founded the Nigerian Tribune, a private Nigerian newspaper</li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> - As head of the Action Group, he led demands for a federal constitution, which was introduced in the 1954 Lyttleton Constitution, 
                    following primarily the model proposed by the Western Region delegation led by him.
                    As premier, he proved to be and was viewed as a man of vision and a dynamic administrator. Awolowo was also the country's leading social democratic politician. 
                    He supported limited public ownership and limited central planning in government. He believed that the state should channel Nigeria's resources into education 
                    and state-led infrastructural development. Controversially, and at considerable expense, he introduced free primary education for all 
                    and free health care for children in the Western Region</li>
                <li><strong>1959</strong> - Established the first television services in Africa, and the Oduduwa Group, all of which were financed from the highly lucrative cocoa industry which was the mainstay of the regional economy.</li>
                <li><strong>1963</strong> - He establshed the University of Ife which is now known as Obafemi Awolowo University</li>
                <li><strong>1967</strong> - He was appointed the federal Commisioner for Finance. In that position, he managed the Nigerian economy throughout the civil war (1967 - 1960).</li>
                <li><strong>1992</strong> - The Obafemi Awolowo Foundation was founded as an independent, non-profit, non-partisan organisation committed to 
                    furthering the symbiotic interaction of public policy and relevant scholarship with a view to promoting the overall development of the Nigerian nation.
                    However, his most important bequests (styled Awoism) are his exemplary integrity, his welfarism, his contributions to hastening the process of decolonisation 
                    and his consistent and reasoned advocacy of federalism-based on ethno-linguistic self-determination and uniting politically strong states-as the best basis for Nigerian unity.</li>
                <li><strong>1987</strong> - Chief Obafemi Awolowo died peacefully at his Ikenne home, the Efunyela Hall on 9th May 1987, at the age of 78 and was laid to rest in Ikenne</li>

                    <p>Awo is overqualified to be described as what Plato called the “philosopher-king,” the ideal leader for a state. Even his big foe, Odumegwu Ojukwu, whose biggest dream Awo brutally crushed, regarded him as a great intellectual and politician.</p>
